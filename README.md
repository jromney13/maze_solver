# Maze Solver

This project uses Breadth First Search to find the most optimal path through a maze with loops.

The maze is stored in a multi-dimensional array and can be manipulated to solve different maze designs.

5 is the start of the maze
8 is the end of the maze
1 are open pathways
0 are walls

This project illustrates my knowledge of the following data structures:
- Queues: Used in the BFS algorithm
- Vectors: Used to store the optimal pathway
- Multi-Dimensional Array - Used to store the maze structure as well as keep track of visited points during BFS algorithm

Algorithms:
- Breadth First Search
